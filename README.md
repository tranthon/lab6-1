# studentrecordsmgmtapp
A Command-Line Java Application (as a Maven project)to be used in managing the Student records for a University and an excerpt of the students' data is given as follows:

s1: studentId:110001, name:Dave, dateOfAdmission:11/18/1951
s2: studentId:110002, name:Anna, dateOfAdmission:12/07/1990
s3: studentId:110003, name:Erica, dateOfAdmission:01/31/1974
s4: studentId:110004, name:Carlos, dateOfAdmission:08/22/2009
s5: studentId:110005, name:Bob, dateOfAdmission:03/05/1990
... etc.

In the MyStudentRecordsMgmtApp class, there is a method named, printListOfStudents, which takes as input, the array of students and it iterates through the objects and prints out all the students data to the console/screen. This print-out should be sorted in ascending order of the Students Names.
Also, in the MyStudentRecordsMgmtApp class, there is an another method named, getListOfPlatinumAlumniStudents, which takes as input, the array of all students and it returns a List of only PlatinumAlumni students. A PlatinumAlumni student is a student who gained admission into the University at least 30 years ago in descending order of their dates of admission.
